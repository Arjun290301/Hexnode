# **Technologies Used**
- React: Component-based UI development.
- React-Bootstrap: For the carousel component and responsive utilities.
- CSS Media Queries: For custom responsiveness and design improvements.
# *Challenges Faced*
## *Overlapping Content:*

- The testimonial text initially overlapped with the image due to improper layout handling.
Solution: Used flexbox with gap and adjusted widths for larger and smaller screens. Added media queries for smooth stacking on mobile.
## *Font Size Adjustment:*

- On smaller screens, the text font size didn’t scale properly.
Solution: Implemented responsive font sizes using media queries.
## *Carousel Navigation Buttons:*

- React-Bootstrap default buttons didn’t match the design requirements.
Solution: Customized navigation buttons using CSS overrides and added custom arrow styles.
